3d map of noise complaints in NYC

## 2d versus 3d
I think applications that benefit from using 3d maps are those that employ topographical or data that can be displayed using
heights or amounts (such as precipitation or temperature). The data must be normalized for it to effectively be used in a
3d map. Other types of maps are better at effectively communicating with 2d representations. These maps include data that is
is a bit more complicated than just showing an amount for a given data. One example is that if you are displaying categorically
values, 2d maps make more sense than 3d maps. Another example is if the map is a cloropleth map, it would be extremely
confusing to read if the map was displayed as a 3d representation. Being mindful of the type of data your map contains can
help determine what dimension is most suited for effectivly communicating the message of the map.
